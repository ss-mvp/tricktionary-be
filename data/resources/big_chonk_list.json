The original Thirteen Colonies declared their independence from Great Britain in 1776 and formed a government under the Articles of Confederation in 1781, adopting (1787) a new constitution that went into effect after 1789. The nation soon began to expand westward. Growing tensions over the issue of black slavery divided the country along geographic lines, sparking the secession of the South and the Civil War (1861–1865). The remainder of the 1800s was marked by increased westward expansion, industrialization, and the influx of millions of immigrants.

Out of the US, French, and British zones West Germany was established in 1949, while the Soviet zone became East Germany.
